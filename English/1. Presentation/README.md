Warren Buffet has just turned 92 years old and is one of the most influential and wealthy business leaders in America.
We will study his logic, discipline and understanding of the investment business.

### Consistency & Patience

During the last year, we have experienced a very high volatility on the financial markets.
Many people are panicking and deviating from their investment strategy.
The legendary investor and founder and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway has made millions of dollars for investors over several decades
In contrast, Warren Buffet makes almost no reactionary decisions, preferring to focus on his investment method.

Here are the impressive results of his investment fund compared to the S&P 500

Warren managed to do 800 times better than the S&P 500 during the same period.

Buffett learned his trade from Benjamin Graham , a Columbia University professor and British economist.
Perhaps for this reason, Buffett generally does not invest in opportunities for which he cannot reasonably estimate future value. 
estimate future value-there are no social networking companies, for example, or crypto-currency companies in his portfolio. 
Instead, he bets on companies that have stable cash flows and will generate high returns and low risk.
Since Buffett bought See's Candy Shops in 1972, the company has generated a return on investment of more than 160 percent per year,
and not because of any significant changes in operations, target customer base or product line. 
The company didn't stop doing what it was doing well just so it could grow faster.

Many of the supposedly ill-advised deals it made in the wake of the 2008 crisis have paid off in the long run.
And news reports suggest that Berkshire Hathaway's earnings are rebounding amid the current economic downturn 
caused by the global pandemic.

At 90, Buffett is still campaigning, for example, against eliminating the estate tax and 
against the publication of quarterly earnings forecasts. On the latter, he said it encourages an unhealthy focus on short-term profits.
unhealthy focus on short-term profits at the expense of long-term performance. "Clear communication
of a company's strategic objectives and metrics that can be measured over time will always be
essential for shareholders. But this information ... must be provided on a schedule that is appropriate
to the needs of each company and its investors, whether annual or otherwise," he and Jamie Dimon wrote in the Wall Street Journal.

Yes, volatile times call for quick responses and quick action. But as Warren Buffett has shown
there are also significant benefits to keeping the long term in mind. Specifically, consistency, prudence,
patience, and trusting the math in good times and bad are assets.
