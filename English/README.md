## Program Structure
The program is divided into several modules for better organization and maintainability. Here is a brief explanation of each module:

main.py: This is the entry point of the program. It contains the main function that handles user input and calls the appropriate functions from the other modules.
data_manager.py: This module handles the loading, cleaning and preprocessing of the data.
analyzer.py: This module contains the functions for analyzing the data and generating the results.
visualizer.py: This module is responsible for creating visualizations of the data and results.
