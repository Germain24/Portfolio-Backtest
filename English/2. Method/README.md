# Warren Buffett's strategy
## Method
We will now see how Warren Buffett chooses the stocks in which he invests.

### Sectors.
Warren buffett does not invest in sectors such as financial services, energy or real estate

### Earnings per share growth.
We want to see a positive evolution of the earnings per share throughout the years.
To calculate earnings per share, you need to divide the revenue per the number of stocks.

### Stockholders equity
We want to see a positive evolution of the stockholder equity throughout the years.

### Cash and cash equivalents.
1. We want the cash and cash equivalent to be over 0$ each year.
2. We want to see a positive growth throughout the years.

### Retained earnings
We want to see a positive evolution of the retained earnings throughout the years.

### Research and development expenses
We want research and development expenses to be under 30% of the revenu minus the cost of revenue.

### Liabilities
1. We want the liabilities to represent less than 50% of assets.
2. We want liabilities to be lower than cash and cash equivalent + assets.

### Return on investment
We want to see an ROI beyond 12%.
To calculate ROI, we use : ROI = Revenue / ( Assets + Liabilities ).

### Gross margin
We want to see a gross margin over 40%.
Gross Margin = (Total Revenue - Cost of Goods Sold)/Total Revenue.

### Net margin
We want to see a net margin over 20%.
Net Margin = Net Income / Total Revenue

### Revenue
We want to see a positive evolution of the revenue throughout the years.

Now we are going to see how to evaluate each of these elements with a Python's script.
