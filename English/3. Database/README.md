2. Financial element from the last 20 years :

   6. Cash and cash equivalents
   7. Research and development expenses
   8. Retained earnings
   9. Operating expenses
   10. Total stockholders equity
   11. Common stock number

For this we are going to take financialmodelingprep.com API.

We need this function to extract data from the API :

````python
from urllib.request import urlopen
import certifi
import json

def get_jsonparsed_data(url):
    response = urlopen(url, cafile=certifi.where())
    data = response.read().decode("utf-8")
    return json.loads(data)
````

I'm going to give you somme exemple :

get_jsonparsed_data function give us a list, each element give us data from most recent one to oldest ones ( [0] for the last and [-1] for the oldest )

### Exemple 1 Apple global information

Code :

````python

print(get_jsonparsed_data(f"https://financialmodelingprep.com/api/v3/profile/AAPL?apikey=ce82b6a14287d6b24fdcaf5468401b12")[0])

````

Output :
