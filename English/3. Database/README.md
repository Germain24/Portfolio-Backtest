# La strat√©gie de Warren Buffett

   4. Country

2. Financial element from the last 20 years :
   1. Revenue

   3. Net income
   4. Total liabilities
   5. Total assets
   6. Cash and cash equivalents
   7. Research and development expenses
   8. Retained earnings
   9. Operating expenses
   10. Total stockholders equity
   11. Common stock number
